# Git & GitHub Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome! 👋  
This repository documents my learning progress as I explore **Git**, **GitHub**, and **GitHub Actions**. I'm building a strong foundation in version control and automation practices.

---

## 🔧 What I've Learned So Far

### ✅ Git Commands
I've practiced using several key Git commands:

- `git add` – Stage changes for commit  
- `git commit` – Save snapshots of the project history  
- `git push` – Upload local changes to GitHub  
- `git status` – Check the status of working directory and staging area  
- `git merge` – Combine changes from different branches  
- `git restore` – Restore files in the working directory  
- `git rm` – Remove files from the working directory and staging area  
- `git remote` – Manage set of tracked repositories  

### 🌿 Branching & Merging
- Created and managed multiple branches
- Merged feature branches into the `main` (or `master`) branch using pull requests on GitHub

---

## 🐍 Python Demo with Code Quality Checks

### 🔎 Flake8
- Created a simple Python demo file
- Used `flake8` locally to check for code quality and styling issues before committing changes

### 🤖 GitHub Actions + Pylint
- Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run `pylint` on every push or pull request
- This helps ensure that all code meets quality standards before being merged

---

## 📚 What's Next?

- Explore more advanced Git workflows (e.g., rebase, stash)
- Write custom GitHub Actions
- Integrate unit tests and continuous integration (CI) tools
- Learn about versioning, releases, and deployment workflows

Thanks for checking out my progress!  
Stay tuned as I continue to improve my workflow and build better development practices.
